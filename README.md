## Developer Test

### Overview

The Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective web developers to see how they do given a coding task.

The premise is simple, create a PHP script that performs a search using the Search API for movies containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow.

The output should be a HTML page that displays each matching movies details (title, year, runtime) on a page. Also, extract the first matching word from the movie title, and show it somewhere on the movie details (maybe as the background colour).

* The PHP can either be above the HTML or inline, but should be properly indented and easy to read.
* The layout needs to be clean and well styled.
* Your CSS can be either internal or external.
* Your HTML and CSS should pass W3 validation (we won't penalise for bleeding edge errors :wink:)

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your Github account (don't fork it please)
2. Create your PHP script, commit it and then push it to Github
3. Email us a link to your completed code
4. You're done!
